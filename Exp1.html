<font color="1327A7"><li><h2>DATA STRUCTURE</h2></li>
<p><i>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.</i></p></font>

<font color="CF1E56"><li><h2>C PROGRAMMING</h2></li>
<p><i>C is a procedural language that provides no support for objects and classes. C++ is a combination of OOP and procedural programming languages. C has 32 keywords and C++ has 63 keywords. C supports built-in data types, while C++ supports both built-in and user-defined data types.</i></p></font>

<p><i>Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics developed by Guido van Rossum. It was originally released in 1991. Designed to be easy as well as fun, the name "Python" is a nod to the British comedy group Monty Python.</i></p></font>

<font color="9916B4"><li><h2>SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h2></li>
<p><i>Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.</i></p></ol></font>
